    "#### 3.2.2\n",
    "(1.5 pts) Repeat the exercise above, using 10-fold cross-validation. K-fold cross-validation works by splitting X into K partitions of equal length. Then in each fold, you choose K-1 partitions as the training set and the remaining partition as the test set. Every partition gets a turn being a test set. For a very nice simple explanation of how (and why) K-fold works, check out http://www.dummies.com/programming/big-data/data-science/resorting-cross-validation-machine-learning/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For each fold, fit a decision tree on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set. Finally, compute the average classification errors on the test- and training sets across the 10 cross-validation folds and plot them as a function of the tree depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "** hints: **\n",
    "*This time the `KFold()` function from the module `sklearn.model_selection` can be used to partition the data into the 10 training and test partitions. Check out http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#k-fold for an example of how to acces the indices for the training set and the test set in each fold. Those indices can then be used to create the training and test set, e.g. `X_train = X[train_indices]`*\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "What appears to be the optimal tree depth? Do you get the same result when you run your code again, generating a new random split between training and test data? How about 100-fold cross-validation?\n"
